				<h1>Full of beans...</h1>
				<p><strong>Anybody else hungry? Try this recipe for Northern bean soup and call me when it's done.</strong></p>
				<h2>Great Northern Bean Family Time Soup</h2>
				<p>When the kids were growing up, this was my "Sunday soup." Each Sunday afternoon it simmered on the stove for a couple of hours, filling the house with a tantalizing smell.</p>
				<h3>Here's what you will need:</h3>
					<ul>
							<li>1 clove of garlic, minced</li>
							<li>2 onions, chopped</li>
							<li>3 stalks of celery, chopped</li>
							<li>2 15.8-oz. cans of Great Northern Beans*</li>
							<li>1/2 cup water</li>
							<li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
							<li>(optional) 1/4 cup ham, pre-cooked and cut into quarter-inch cubes</li>
							<li>large non-stick skillet with a lid</li>
							<li>non-stick spatula</li>
							<li>wooden spoon (for stirring and, if desired, for tasting)</li>
					</ul>
				<h5>* For those on low-sodium diets, we recommend Bush's brand reduced-sodium Great Northern Beans.</h5>
				<h3>Directions:</h3>
					<ol>
	   						<li>Warm the olive oil in the skillet.</li>
							<li>Add the garlic, onions and celery and cook on medium heat until soft.</li>
							<li>(optional) Add the ham and raise the temperature slightly to brown it.</li>
							<li>Add the beans and the water.</li>
							<li>Simmer for about two hours, stirring frequently, until everyone gets home.</li>
							<li>While stirring, use the spatula to scrape the bottom of the skillet so the soup doesn't stick and burn.</li>
							<li> Add water as necessary.</li>
							<li> Season and garnish to taste.</li>
					</ol>
